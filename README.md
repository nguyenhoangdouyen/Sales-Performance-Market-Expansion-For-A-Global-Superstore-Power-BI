## 📌 Background & Overview

**Objective:**

**📖 What is this project about?**

This project aims to build a **Power BI dashboard** using the *Global Superstore Sales* dataset, which includes data on transactions (**Orders**), sales representatives (**People**), and product returns (**Returns**).
The goal is to provide senior managers with **data-driven insights** to:

- **Understand current business performance**
 
- **Optimize market expansion strategies**

- **Identify strategic products for growth**

- **Support better decision-making to drive revenue and ROI**


**👤 Who is this project for?**

✔️ Data analysts & business analysts seeking actionable insights.

✔️ Marketing and sales teams focusing on product performance and market growth.

✔️ Route to market team aiming to improve distribution strategies and market reach.


**❓Business Questions:**

✔️ What is the current performance of Superstore?

✔️ Which markets should Superstore expand into to increase revenue and ROI?

✔️ Which products should be prioritized for strategic growth?


**🎯Project Outcome:**

- Revenue increased significantly, but profit margin remained flat, indicating rising costs and limited operational efficiency gains.  
- Canada emerged as a high-margin market (28%) despite low revenue, while Africa and EMEA showed the fastest YoY growth, revealing expansion potential.  
- Oceania and Africa attracted the most new customers, whereas most revenue still came from loyal, returning buyers.  
- Technology led revenue growth and profitability, but return rates in some tech SKUs (e.g., Cisco, Motorola) impacted margins.  
- Products like Copiers delivered the highest profit per unit, while low-performing items (e.g., Suppliers, Furnishings) diluted overall profitability.

By aligning regional and product strategies, senior managers can **scale in high-margin markets**, **invest in scalable profitable categories**, and **optimize acquisition and return management**, driving **sustainable long-term growth**.
